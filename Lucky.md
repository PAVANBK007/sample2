#INTERESTS

  **Poetry** : I read a quote out there, it goes like "A lot of people can code, but there are a few who can write poetry." And here is me who can do the both...:)
  
  **Script Writing** : Whenever there is any ceremony or function in college, "Stage pr bolte anchors hain, pr shabad hmare hote hain"
  
  **Exploring new food and culture** : I love to interact with people of different cultures. I always try to learn good things from their culture. 
  There are three ways to impress me
  1. Make food for me
  2. Buy me food
  3. Be the food
  
  **Coding** : I had never code before my 1st year. Once I saw my roommate writing some unusual english words on black screen. After struggling for half an hour he wrote           "Hello, World" 5 times on the screen. He became very happy. He shouted out of joy. I want to feel that happiness. The curosity to feel that happiness brings me into coding       world. 
  I worked on my problem solving during college. Waiting to apply that in development field.
 
#THINGS I WANT TO LEARN ***(PS: I'll work on them once I am done with Golang, FastApi, AWS, Git, Linux, Docker and Kubernetes!!!)
We must be honest with the things related to our carrer...:)*** Anyways, the list is...

  **Photography** : Very Important skill. It consists of two basic parts:
  1. Clicking a photo
  2. Posing for a photo
  
  It is advisable to have a good command over both. It helps us to capture beautiful moments of our life. Moreover, *baizatti hone se bachati hai ye skill.* Imagine going to a     group trip and you don't know how to click good photos, you don't know how to pose. You gonna end up with not having any good pic of yourself. *Paisa barbad....:/*
  
  **Dancing** : Once a leagend said "*95% laundo ko naahcna nhi aata hai*. There are occassions where we may have to perform, to avoid that embarrasment and to enjoy the moment    by dancing with other, we must learn some steps which we can perform on stage...:)
  
  **Enhancing my cooking skiils** : In support of AATAMNIRBHAR BHARAT ABHIYAN, I want to be very good in cooking. If you have stucked in your flat during pendamic, you know the     importance of cooking...:)
