Introduction
Name: Pulkit Kaushik- My name is synonym for the word 'Happy' and I always try to be as my name says.

Linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/pulkit-kaushik (500+ connections- Just beacuse people say that looks nice & make you more representable. OKay, i hear you on that).

Interests: Very serious word and bit difficult to answer but few of them i will try to pointout that i like to play outdoor games I am myself national level gymnastics player and football player. On the technical side I really enjoy working and coding with Java but sad to see my first and favourite language is being ignored by new companies and no one want to work with it anymore which i feel is somewhere acceptable(Jb python mein ek kaam 2 line mein ho skta hai to kyun 10 line likhna or statically typed language mein kyu fasna jb python sb smbhaal lega or easy hai). So I am finding same zist in python & trying learning Golang.Rest i will explore as the time will pass under aptus data labs and my seniors.
